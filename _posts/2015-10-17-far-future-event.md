Ramani Huria invites you to our the October Maptime event, with the theme “Map Kigamboni"! The goal for the Maptime event is to have data available on OpenStreetMap for all to freely access and use. 

We invite enthusiastic and new mappers to also help edit areas of Tanzania that need maps! If you're new to mapping, you are also welcome - the Ramani Huria team can assist you with all the tools you need to be part of mapping your community!

Maptime is hands-on, so don’t forget to bring your laptop! All skill levels are welcome. Newbies are especially welcome! Follow us on twitter at @MaptimeTZ.
