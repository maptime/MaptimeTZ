Maptime Tanzania and Ramani Huria invites you to the September Maptime, with the theme “Map Dodoma", a chance to really put the capital city of Tanzania 'on the map'! The goal for the mapping party is to have this data available on OpenStreetMap for all to freely access and use. We're excited to be holding our mapping party for the first time at the Kinu Innovation Space, located at https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2410073752

We invite enthusiastic and new mappers to help edit areas that need maps with the use of the HOT Tasking Manager. If you're new to mapping, you are also welcome - the Ramani Huria team can assist you with all the tools you need to be part of mapping your community.

Maptime is hands-on, so don’t forget to bring your laptop! All skill levels are welcome. Newbies are especially welcome! Follow us on twitter at @MaptimeTZ.
