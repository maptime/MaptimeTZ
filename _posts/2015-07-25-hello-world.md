title: Welcome to Maptime Tanzania
---

We meet once a month to work on maps, learn about geospatial data, and teach each other the latest cartographic tools. Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.

This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?

Maptime is hands-on, so donâ€™t forget to bring your laptop! All skill levels are welcome. Newbies are especially welcome! Follow us on twitter at @MaptimeTZ.

Maptime Tanzania is a local chapter of the world-wide Maptime movement! Check out Maptime HQ at maptime.io.
