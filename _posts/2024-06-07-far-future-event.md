This event will be a fun collaboration with the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/) The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development. 

1. Learn about the Humanitarian OpenStreetMapTeam (HOT) 
2. Get introduced to [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org/) and 
3. Dive into contributing to a HOT project using the tasking manager.

[OSM Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.  

This approach facilitates the distribution of tasks to the various mappers in a context of emergency. It also permits to control the progress and the homogeinity of the work done (ie. Elements to cover, specific tags to use, etc.).

Maptime is hands-on, so donâ€™t forget to bring your laptop! All skill levels are welcome. Newbies are especially welcome! Follow us on twitter at @MaptimeTZ.
