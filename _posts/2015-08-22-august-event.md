Hello welcome to yet another exciting Maptime event with Ramani Huria. This month's Maptime is dubbed 
“Map My Hometown On OSM” (#MMHOSM). Come and enjoy being part of the efforts to bring your community 
and hometown onto OpenStreetMap and viewable for the world to see! The towns selected are: Dodoma in the Central Region, 
Arusha, Mwanza, Tanga, Kilimanjaro in the North, Kigoma in the West, Mbeya in the South and Dar es Salaam in the East. 
Have the opportunity to meet fellow OpenStreetMappers in Tanzania, share your experiences and skills.

You will also have the chance to learn about an exciting tool that has started to be used in Tanzania. 
Get to know about Mapillary a mobile application used for crowdsourcing map photos using simple tools 
like smartphones. The application is free on the Google Play Store, so you can try it out even before 
the maptime, then share your experience with the audience.
