Join us for the next Maptime Tanzania mapping event! This month we'll be mapping task #1446 on OSM Tasking Manager: http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1446

Throughout the event we will be announcing mapping leaders and OSM fighter winners so stay engaged with mappers at the event and throughout the world through social media and on JOSM GeoChat!

We'll be having a Tweetchat with the hashtag #MaptimeTz & message or Tweet us directly @RamaniHuria

Maptime Tanzania gatherings (previously also called mapping parties) are held once a month and are open to all members of the community, in addition to students who have previously been involved with Ramani Huria.

We invite enthusiastic and new mappers to also help edit areas that need maps with the use of the HOT Tasking Manager. If you're new to mapping, you are also welcome - the Ramani Huria team can assist you with all the tools you need to be part of mapping your community!
